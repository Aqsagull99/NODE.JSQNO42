// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

    magicians.forEach(magician => console.log(magician));

function makegreat(magicians: string[]): string[] {
